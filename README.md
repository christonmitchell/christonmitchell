👋 Hi, I’m @christonmitchell

👀 I’m passionate about network security, penetration testing, and how to secure and defend against cyberattacks. I’m focused on understanding network vulnerabilities, securing infrastructures, and detecting weaknesses before they can be exploited.

🌱 I’m currently learning about network penetration testing, secure coding practices in Python and C, network protocols, and attack vectors. I’m also diving into security assessments and tools used in real-world security testing.

💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on network security projects, vulnerability research, and developing security tools to improve defenses. I’m particularly interested in working on securing networks, detecting vulnerabilities, and contributing to security assessments.

📫 How to reach me: You can reach me via email at christonmitchell@example.com or connect with me on LinkedIn here :https://www.linkedin.com/in/christon-mitchell-581284287/.

😄 Pronouns: He/Him

⚡ Fun fact: In my free time, I love solving network-related capture the flag (CTF) challenges and exploring new attack vectors to better understand how to secure networks. I also have a growing interest in the security of IoT devices.
